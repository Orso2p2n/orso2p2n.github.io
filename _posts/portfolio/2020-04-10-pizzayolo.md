PizzaYolo is a card board game inspired by [Happy Families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Families), made in a week as a student project during my second year at [ICAN](https://www.ican-design.fr/).

The goal is to complete enough pizzas before the other players, by discarding and drawing ingredients, until you have all the ones you need.
