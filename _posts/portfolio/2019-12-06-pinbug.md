**Pinbug** is a small game, developed in a week during a game jam organized by my school, with the theme "pinball".

## Gameplay

Pinbug is a classic pinball prototype with a slight twist: there are multiple balls in play, but with only one active at a time. If the active ball touches an inactive one, it will transfer its momentum.
