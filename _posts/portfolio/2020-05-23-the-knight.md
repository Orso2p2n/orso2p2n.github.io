**The Knight** is a playable character mod for [_Rivals of Aether_](https://rivalsofaether.com/), adding the Knight from [_Hollow Knight_](https://www.hollowknight.com/) in the game.

This project was developed as part of the [ZPMods](https://twitter.com/zpmods?lang=fr) team.

This was our first _Rivals of Aether_ mod, as well as the first mod we ever developed together.

## Gameplay

The goal with the mod was to **bring the character** from _Hollow Knight_ directly into _Rivals of Aether_.

Thus, we took **heavy inspiration** from the original game for our moveset. A lot of the attacks, if not all, are a **direct reference** to something in _Hollow Knight_.

For example:
- The forward, up and down aerial attacks are directly taken from the **directional attacks** of the original game.

- The special attacks are all inspired by **spells and upgrades** from the original game.

- The taunt is inspired by the **checkpoints** from the original game.
