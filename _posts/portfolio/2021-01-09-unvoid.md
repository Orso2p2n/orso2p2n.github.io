**Unvoid** is an esoteric and chaotic sculpting tool, based on **merging primitive shapes**. The user can create random shapes that will fall on and merge into the central structure.

This project was developed for a **Creative Coding class**, during my third year at [ICAN](https://www.ican-design.fr/).

## Itch.io

Unvoid is playable on [itch.io](https://orsopidou.itch.io/ccoding).
