Unvoid is an esoteric and chaotic sculpting tool, based on merging primitive shapes. The user can create random shapes that will fall on and merge into the central structure.

This project was made in the context of a Creative Coding class, during my third year at [ICAN](https://www.ican-design.fr/).
