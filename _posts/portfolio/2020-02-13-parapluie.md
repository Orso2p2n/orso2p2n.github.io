**Parapluie** is a 3D platformer prototype where you get to freely control an umbrella on the roofs of Paris.

It was developed in [_Dreams_](https://indreams.me/) during the **official launch Game Jam**, organized during an interactive exhibition in Paris. We, along with a dozen other students of [ICAN](https://www.ican-design.fr/), were selected to take part in this Game Jam and contribute to the game’s online library.

## Development

### Preparation

Prior to the Jam, we had **one week** to learn _Dreams_ from the ground up, and **in complete autonomy**: programming with nodes, 3D, texturing, effects, sound, etc.

The theme of the Jam was only revealed on the final day of the week, so we couldn’t make any asset beforehand.
      
The 48 hours jam started following this week. It took place during the exhibition, in a second room where guests, journalists and Media Molecule developers could walk in and watch us work.

### Game Jam

**The theme for the Jam was “Paris”.**

Firstly, we had a brainstorm session where we discussed how we were gonna adapt the subject. With only 48 hours in front of us, a team of two people and only one console, we decided to focus on making a **small gameplay prototype** to showcase what the game could be with enough time.

While Dreams is community-focused engine (meaning you can freely download and reuse assets from an online library), we decided to **make all our assets from scratch** during the Jam. This meant that we had to adopt a modular type-of workflow when creating, so that we could make everything in this short time window.

## Indreams

The game can be found on [indreams](https://indreams.me/dream/mmgqNMBuZZV), the game's official platform.

## Team

The Game Jam was in teams of two, and while we both experimented with everything, we decided to focus on our strong points and divided the work as follow:
- **Orso Philipponnat** - Programming, Level Design, Visual Effects
- **Abigaëlle Batt** - 3D Modeling, Paint Texturing, Character Design
