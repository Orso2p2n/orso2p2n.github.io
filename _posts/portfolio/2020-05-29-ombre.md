**Ombre** is a puzzle game, developed as our second semester project, during our second year at [ICAN](https://www.ican-design.fr/).

## Gameplay

Ombre is a puzzle game with two different character controllers:
- One in 3D, first person view, able to walk around and grab objects to move them around. 
- One in 2D, side view, constrained to one of the walls of the room, able to walk right and left and to jump.

The main mechanic is that **shadows cast by objects in the 3D world** become **collisions in the 2D world**, letting the 2D character walk on them.

The goal of the player is to find a way to bring the 2D character to the end of the level (usually at the end of the wall) by moving objects and lights around.

Additionally, the lights can be colored, disabling 3D collisions and shadow casting for the objects of the same color.

## Iterations

### First prototype

The first prototype already included the base of the gameplay, including:
- In 3D:
  - 3D character movement.
  - Ability to move objects.
- In 2D:
  - 2D character movement.
  - Shadow detection and collision creation.

### Colored light

- Added colored objects and the ability to change the light's color.
  - Objects with the same color as the light don't cast a shadow.
- Improved object manipulation by adding a lerp to it and using forces.
  - Objects can now be thrown by flinging the camera.
- Added the ability for the 2D character to change wall (this went unused in the final prototype)

### Static objects

- Added static objects.
- Added the ability to rotate objects when moving them.
- Added objects restrained to a certain perimeter.
- Improved 2D character movement with coyote time.

### Artistic beginnings

- Started implementing the artistic direction.
- Objects with the same color as the light appear transparent.
- Added "safe zones" in the 2D environment, where shadow collisions cannot be created.
- Added the end of the level in the 2D environment.

### More art, more mechanics

- Changed models and visuals of a bunch of stuff.
- Added visuals for static objects, the 2D character, the lamps...
- Added a button on lamps to turn them on.
  - Only one lamp can be on at a time.
- Added a "rain" obstacle in 2D, that kills the character if touched.
  - The rain can be blocked by using a shadow as an umbrella.
- Added checkpoints in 2D.
- Added a button in 2D, that can trigger various effects, including removing certain 3D objects.

### Final build

- Changed visuals for checkpoints, lamps, static objects...
- Added particle effects.
- Removed cluttering grass in the 3D environment.
