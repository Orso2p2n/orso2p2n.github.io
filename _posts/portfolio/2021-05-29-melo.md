**Melo** is a mobile puzzle game, developed as our final yeah project at [ICAN](https://www.ican-design.fr/).

The game was first designed as a toy without any objective during the first semester, and then refined into a demo during the second semester.

## Gameplay

In Melo, the player plays as a King, ordering a group of little creatures (known as Melos) around using music.

_The King and the Melos._

The player has access to a keyboard, with **3 rows** of buttons:
- **Subjects**
- **Action verbs**
- **Objects**

Additionally, the "Stop" button is available to stop any ongoing order.

Pressing those buttons will **fill up an "order sentence"**, that the Melos will then execute.

The goal of the player is to, in each level, bring enough Melos and the King to the exit.
