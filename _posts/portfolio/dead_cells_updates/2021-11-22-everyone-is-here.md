## Introduction

Update 2.6, officially named **Everyone is Here**, a crossover with 6 other indie games, with the goal of bringing items and outfits inspired by those games into _Dead Cells_.

The 6 games we had the opportunity to work with were _Blasphemous_, _Curse of the Dead Gods_, _Guacamelee_, _Hollow Knight_, _Hyper Light Drifter_ and _Skul_.

### Notable additions and changes

- **NEW** - Crossover content: one new weapon per game, as well as an outfit inspired by their main character.
  - _Blasphemous_:
    - [Face Flask](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Face_Flask), a niche weapon that inflicts a small amount of damage to the player upon activation.
    - [Penitent's Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Penitent's_Outfit).
  - _Curse of the Dead Gods_:
    - [Machete and Pistol](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Machete_and_Pistol), slashes with the machete twice, then shoots with the pistol once.
    - [Explorer's Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Explorer's_Outfit).
  - _Guacamelee_:
    - [Pollo Power](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Pollo_Power), turns the player into a bomb-laying chicken for a short time.
    - [Luchador's Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Luchador's_Outfit).
  - _Hollow Knight_:
    - [Pure Nail](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Pure_Nail), the first weapon in the game with directional attacks. The aerial downward attack lets the player bounce on enemies.
    - [Vessel's Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Vessel's_Outfit).
  - _Hyper Light Drifter_:
    - [Hard Light Sword / Hard Light Gun](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Hard_Light_Sword), a two handed weapon(s) that work in synergy with itself. Shoot projectiles at enemies with the gun, and hit them with the sword to regenerate ammo.
    - [The Magician's Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#The_Magician's_Outfit).
  - _Skul_
    - [Bone](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Bone), hitting with this club sends the player into a powerful whirlwind attack.
    - [Little Bone's Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Little_Bone's_Outfit).

## What I worked on

During the development of this update, most of my work was focused on the [Queen and the Sea DLC](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/queen-and-the-sea/), which means that most of my contributions were through [bug fixes](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_2.6#Bug_fixes), rather than actual features.
