## Introduction

Update 3.2, officially named **Everyone is Here Vol. 2**, is a second instance of crossover update, with 6 new indie games, with the goal of bringing items and outfits inspired by those games into _Dead Cells_.

The 6 games we had the opportunity to work with were _Shovel Knight_, _Hotline Miami_, _Katana Zero_, _Risk of Rain 2_, _Terraria_ and _Slay the Spire_.

### Notable additions and changes

- **NEW** - Crossover content: one new weapon per game, as well as an outfit inspired by their main character.
  - _Hollow Knight_:
    - [King Scepter](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/King_Scepter), inspired by King Knight, makes the player dash forward, enter a spinning state if they touch anything, and let them bounce around on enemies.
    - [Shovel Knight Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Shovel_Knight_Outfit).
  - _Hotline Miami_:
    - [Baseball Bat](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Baseball_Bat), a fast weapon that inflicts critical damage on stunned enemies (with a special animation!).
    - [Modernized Bomber Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Modernized_Bomber_Outfit).
  - _Katana Zero_:
    - [Throwable Objects](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Throwable_Objects), fast-moving projectiles that stun enemies, with ammo that refills on kill.
    - [Zero Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Zero_Outfit).
  - _Risk of Rain 2_:
    - [Laser Glaive](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Laser_Glaive), throws a seeking projectile that bounces between enemies, with increased damage with each bounce.
    - [Commando Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Commando_Outfit).
  - _Terraria_:
    - [Starfury](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Starfury), hitting with this weapon summons a falling star that targets a nearby enemy.
    - [Familiar Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Familiar_Outfit).
  - _Slay the Spire_
    - [Diverse Deck](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Diverse_Deck), one of the most complicated skills in the game. The deck is composed of 4 different cards, each with a Draw, Passive and Discard effect. The current card has its Passive in effect permanently, pressing the button will Discard it and Draw the next one, triggering the corresponding effects.
    - [Ironclad Outfit](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Outfits#Ironclad_Outfit).
