## What I worked on

### Training Room reworks

The [Training Room](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Training_Room) changes had been on the backburner for a while at this point. Some features had been requested by the community for a while, while others were intended to be there since [update 2.5](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/queen-and-the-sea/) and it was decided that 3.4 was the right update to add them.

As I was the main programmer on the Training Room, I also took care of all the reworks and improvements.

We added a new menu that lets the player freely spawn any weapon they want, instead of them having to choose a randomly generated set.

Next to the weapon selection, we added a new interactable object that allows the player to choose a specific amount of stats. Before the update, they would always be at base stats, with no way of increasing them.

_Stats selection UI._

With the ability of increasing their stats, we also needed a way to increase the enemies' stats. For that, we added another interactable object that allows the player to change the difficulty level of the Training Room, by copying the values of an existing level.

To let the player experiment with more game mechanics, we added environment hazards to some of the fighting rooms.

Finally, we overhauled the UI of the mob spawners, going from a line-based selection to a grid-based one, to improve readability.
