  - Three weapons that all interact with gold.
- **NEW** - [Midas' Blood](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Midas%27_Blood), [Gold Plating](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Gold_Plating) and [Get Rich Quick](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Get_Rich_Quick).
  - Three mutations that all interact with gold.

## What I worked on

### The weapons

The three weapons added in the update all have mechanics centered around gold:
- **Gold Digger**
  - A melee weapon resembling a pickaxe. Enemies hit with the weapon drop gold, and having enough gold makes it deal critical hits.
- **Dagger of Profit**
  - A dagger that deals critical hits for a few seconds after the player picks up any kind of gold.
- **Money Shooter**
  - A ranged weapons, firing projectiles in the form of nuggets, removing some gold from the player's inventory each time.

_Gif of a player using the Money Shooter, then the Gold Digger._

In _Dead Cells_, the player can carry two weapons and three mutations at a time. The goal was for those to synergize not only with each other, but also with the mutations. Having some mechanics that give, take away or react to gold lets the player combine them and play around with them.

I was tasked with implementing all three of the weapons above. Their overall mechanics were already designed, but I had creative liberty for their implementation and for some specific values (such as the amount of gold used by the Money shooter, or the duration of the Dagger of Profit buff.)
