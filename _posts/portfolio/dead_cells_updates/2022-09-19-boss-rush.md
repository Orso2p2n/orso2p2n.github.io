  - Added even more unique legendary affixes to some weapons.

## What I worked on

During the development of this update, most of my work was focused on [update 3.2](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/everyone-is-here-vol-2/) and the [Return To Castlevania DLC](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/queen-and-the-sea/), which means that most of my contributions were through [bug fixes](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_3.1#Bug_fixes), rather than actual features.
