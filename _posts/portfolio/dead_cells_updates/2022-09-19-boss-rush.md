## Introduction

Update 2.5, officially named **Practice Makes Perfect**, was the first update I worked on upon joining the team.

The goal of the update was to add new quality of life features, in order to ease the game's difficulty curve.

### Notable additions and changes

- **NEW** - [Boss Rush](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Boss_Rush)
  - An alternative game mode, accessible in the first area of the game, where the player can fight bosses back-to-back with randomly generated items.
- **REWORK** - More [legendary affixes](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Affixes#Legendary_affixes)
  - Added even more unique legendary affixes to some weapons.

> A full list of changes can be found on the [Dead Cells Wiki](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_3.0).

## What I worked on

During the development of this update, most of my work was focused on [update 3.2](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/everyone-is-here-vol-2/) and the [Return To Castlevania DLC](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/queen-and-the-sea/), which means that most of my contributions were through [bug fixes](https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_3.0#Bug_fixes), rather than actual features.
