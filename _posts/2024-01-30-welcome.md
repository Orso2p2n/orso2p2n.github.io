Welcome!

My name is Orso Philipponnat, I am a game developer, more specifically programmer and pixel artist.

You might know me for my work on [_Dead Cells_](/portfolio/dead-cells-updates/) during my two and a half years at [Evil Empire](https://evilempirestudio.com/).

This blog is intended mostly for game development, as I will try to share progress on personal projects, tips and tricks I find over the years, small tutorials, etc.

This website also serves as a personal <i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> [Portfolio](/portfolio/) and <i class="fas fa-palette"></i> [Art Gallery](art-gallery/).
